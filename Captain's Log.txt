QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:
	Q:	The script is stuck.
	A:	That has a tendency to happen; an RNG-based event that sometimes happens after finishing a poem in act 2 was especially annoying for me while trying to test the script.
		The only thing you can do about it right now is press [ to stop the script and completely restart the game.

	Q:	The script gets stuck at a specific point in the game.
	A:	Create an issue describing where it gets stuck and I might try to fix it eventually
		Better yet, if you're feeling particularly bored and know a bit of AutoHotkey, fork the project, fix the issue, and create a pull request.
